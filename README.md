# UMusic

A music player that packs in your favorite online services with a local player as well.

## History

UMusic was created with the intention of bringing together all of my desired features for a music player, all into one place.

This player does not yet have a release, as I do not think it is ready enough for public use.

## Credits

Thank you to all who helped in this project.
